# Items-Needed-for-New-Apartment
A tool for managing and printing a list of items needed for setting up 
a new apartment. Allows users to input a list of items for a new apartment,
specify their quantities, and mark whether each item is needed or
already obtained. The program then prints the items in a
formatted manner, making it easy for users to keep track of
what they need for their new apartment setup.
